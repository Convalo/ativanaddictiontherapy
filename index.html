              <h2><strong>ATIVAN ADDICTION THERAPY: WHAT TO KNOW AND WHO TO SEE</strong></h2>
              <p>It&rsquo;s difficult to find an effective drug which does not have addictive aspects to it. Of course, we&rsquo;re not talking about aspirin here, or some other very mild form of painkiller. </p>
              <p>What we&rsquo;re outlining is that most drugs that invariably make a person feel no more pain, or cause another person to have extreme focus on their tasks, can have extremely negative implications if they are used too long, or abused as far as dosage level is concerned.</p>
              <p>These drugs, by the way, are easily purchased over the counter, with fake I.D.s among other sorts of illicit identification.</p>
              <p>Or, more convenient yet, is one can find Ativan on the street with who-knows-what cut with it, or more-than-likely find Ativan in our parents&rsquo; or other relatives&rsquo; and/or friends&rsquo; medical stash.              </p>
              <h2><strong>WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF ATIVAN ADDICTION?</strong></h2>
              <h2>Because Ativan is highly addictive, most in the medical profession suggest use of the drug be supervised by a doctor or clinical expert.<strong></strong></h2>
              <p>Secondly, Ativan should also be <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">prescribed for short periods of use</a> because of the strong risk of physical and psychological dependence that the drug causes.<br>
                Of course, the most severe side effects associated with Ativan use occur during exposure to high doses of the drug. These side effects can include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Depressed respiration</li>
                <li>Seizures</li>
                <li>Memory impairment</li>
                <li>Excessive sedation</li>
                <li>Tremors</li>
                <li>Loss of consciousness              </li>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>WHAT IS THE BEST TYPE OF ATIVAN ADDICTION THERAPY?</strong></h2>
              <p>A gradual weaning of <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> is so far the best approach to tempering and finally overcoming addiction to the drug.</p>
              <p>Of course, this should be <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/inpatient-vs-outpatient-care">performed only under supervision</a> of a qualified doctor and/or staff whose specialty is drug abuse and addiction. This tapering off from Ativan should also take place in facilities equipped in case an emergency occurs.</p>
              <p>Common emergencies <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/substance-abuse-treatment-centers-numbers">during detox and rehabilitation</a> from Ativan addiction include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Anxiety and nausea that can be due to the drug no longer calming the user. They are now anxious and scattered, which can lead to psychological, emotional and physical stress.</li>
                <li>A need to increase the dosage of their Ativan because they&rsquo;ve built up tolerance to the drug.</li>
                <li>Cravings, which are known as the true sign of the psychological aspect of Ativan addiction. With cravings, you or your loved one&rsquo;s mind is affixed to Ativan and little else. Cravings are at their worst during initial withdrawal, and can include:              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Headache</li>
                  <li>Sweating</li>
                  <li>Trembling and shaking</li>
                  <li>Muscle spasms</li>
                  <li>Dizziness</li>
                  <li>Nausea</li>
                  <li>Rapid heart rate</li>
                  <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>If you suspect you or a loved one might have an addiction to Ativan, consult with a reputable detoxification and rehabilitation facility, <em>especially if you believe you cannot successfully recover on your own.</em></p>
              <p>Recovery is not easy, simple, or even safe. Find out what program fits your needs and sign up as soon as possible. The beauty, freedom and safety of an addiction-free life awaits you.</p></div></div>
